## Deployment

1. Deploy the Infection Monkey OVA by choosing **Deploy OVF Template** and following the wizard instructions. *Note: make sure ports 5000 and 5001 on the machine are accessible for inbound TCP traffic.*
2. Turn on the Infection Monkey VM.
3. Log in to the machine with the following credentials:
   1. Username: **monkeyuser**
   2. Password: **Noon.Earth.Always**
4. It's recommended you change the machine passwords by running the following commands: `sudo passwd monkeyuser`, `sudo passwd root`.

## OVA network modes

You can use the OVA in one of two modes:

1. In a network with the DHCP configured— In this case, the Monkey Island will automatically query and receive an IP address from the network.
2. With a static IP address — For this case, you should login to the VM console with the username `root` and the password `G3aJ9szrvkxTmfAG`. After logging in, edit the interfaces file by writing the following command in the prompt:

    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
    ```

    Change the lines:

    ```sh
    auto ens160
    iface ens160 inet dhcp
    ```

    to the following:

    ```sh
    auto ens160
    iface ens160 inet static
    address AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD
    netmask XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    gateway YYY.YYY.YYY.YYY
    ```

    Save the changes then run the command:

    ```sh
    sudo ifdown ens160 && ifup ens160
    ```

## Upgrading

There's no "upgrade-in-place" option for VMware. To get the new version, download the updated file. If you'd like to keep your existing configuration, you can export it to a file by using the Export button and then import it to the new server.
