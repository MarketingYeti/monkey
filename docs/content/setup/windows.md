1. Follow the steps to complete the installation.
1. Run the Monkey Island by clicking on the desktop shortcut.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Windows update

The installer requires [Windows update #2999226](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows). If youâ€™re having trouble running the installer, please make sure to install the update via Windows Update or manually from the link above.

### Supported browsers

The Monkey Island supports Chrome (and Chrome-based) browsers. Some Windows Servers only have Internet Explorer installed, so make sure you're using Chrome or a similar modern browser. [You can download Google Chrome here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Upgrading

To upgrade the Infection Monkey on Windows, download the new installer and run it. The new Monkey version will install over the old one.

If you'd like to keep your existing configuration, you can export it to a file using the export button and then import it to the new server.
